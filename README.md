# GCP Icons for PlantUML

PlantUML macros and sprites for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services. Easily create professional diagrams with GCP components for architecture, workflows, and network topologies.

---

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

Add the GCP icons to your PlantUML project by including the following line in your `.puml` file:

```plantuml
!includeurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LucienBrule/gcp-icons-for-plantuml/master/dist/GCPCommon.puml
```

You can include icons for specific services or categories. For example:

```plantuml
!includeurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LucienBrule/gcp-icons-for-plantuml/master/dist/ai_platform/ai_platform.puml
!includeurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LucienBrule/gcp-icons-for-plantuml/master/dist/anthos_config_management/anthos_config_management.puml
```

---

## ðŸ“„ Example Diagram

```plantuml
@startuml HelloWorld

' Include common macros and service-specific macros
!includeurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LucienBrule/gcp-icons-for-plantuml/master/dist/GCPCommon.puml
!includeurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LucienBrule/gcp-icons-for-plantuml/master/dist/ai_platform/ai_platform.puml
!includeurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LucienBrule/gcp-icons-for-plantuml/master/dist/anthos_config_management/anthos_config_management.puml

LAYOUT_LEFT_RIGHT

actor "Developer" as dev

ai_platform(aiAlias, "AI Platform", "Training & Serving")
anthos_config_management(cfgAlias, "Anthos Config Management", "Policy as Code", "Enforces governance")

dev --> aiAlias : triggers job
aiAlias --> cfgAlias : fetches config

```

You can view a listing of all available services and categories in the `dist/` directory.
Or if you want to see a table of all available services and categories, you can view the [GCP Services and Categories](dist/GCPSymbols.md)
